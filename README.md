# Metonymy

## Data Type Choice

Team Metonymy chose to implement linked nodes as the undelying data structure for our deque. We chose linked nodes because the add and remove methods for nodes have a runtime of O(1). The remove method for both arrays and ArrayLists has a runtime of 0(n), which is less efficient than the one for linked nodes

## Method Selection

For our implementation of a deque class, we chose:
* addFirst() - adds an element to the front of a deque
* addLast() - adds an element to the end of a deque
* removeFirst() - removes an element from the front of a deque
* removeLast() - removes an element from the end of a deque
* getFirst()
* getLast()
* size()
* isEmpty()
* toString()
